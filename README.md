# Ohtu Autum/2022 - Transpilation methods for quantum computers

## About the project:
 
The goal of the project is to create a transpiler for quantum circuits based on the research of Arianne Meijer-van de Griend. The aim is to merge the finished project to IBM's [Qiskit Library](https://github.com/Qiskit).

### PermRowColSynthesis Transpiler

The client's research is focused on the efficient compilation methods of qubits in quantum circuits. The algorithm PermRowCol that we implemented in this project reroutes CNOT gates in a quantum circuit.

## How the project is executed by the group:

The project is executed by using scrum -methods. In such, the time has been devided on sprints, where the time differs between from a week to two weeks, depending on the nature of the tasks, and the clients wishes. (In the begining, the duration of the sprints were one week, but changed to two later). The sprint is started with client meeting where group presents the progress of the project to the client, and after discussing on upcoming tasks, the group helds the sprint palnning, and sprint review.

Group keeps from two to three daily meetings in a week.

Group members haven't got much of an experience on operating projects with using scrum methods. 

Group works in english.


### Implementing code:

Group decided to work on separate branches, and merging those with main after the code has been validated. In the beginning of the project, group decided there should be at least three members who has reviewed the pull request, but later decided to lower it into two. Also client was added to be able to see the requests as well, and be able to give comments on the code to make process go forward more easier.
