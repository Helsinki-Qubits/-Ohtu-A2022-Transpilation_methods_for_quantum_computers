## How the project is executed by the group:

The project is executed by using scrum -methods. In such, the time has been devided on sprints, where the time differs between from a week to two weeks, depending on the nature of the tasks, and the clients wishes. (In the begining, the duration of the sprints were one week, but changed to two later). The sprint is started with client meeting where group presents the progress of the project to the client, and after discussing on upcoming tasks, the group helds the sprint palnning, and sprint review.

Group keeps from two to three daily meetings in a week.

Group members haven't got much of an experience on operating projects with using scrum methods. Group works in english.


### Implementing code:

Group decided to work on seperate branches, and merging those with main after the code has been validated.
